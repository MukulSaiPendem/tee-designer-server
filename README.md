# 🛠️ Tee Designer Backend

This repository contains the backend server for the Tee Designer application. It is responsible for managing API requests, handling user-generated designs, and connecting to external services like OpenAI.

---

## 🔧 Features

- **RESTful API**: Provides endpoints for managing designs and generating AI-powered logos.
- **AI Integration**: Uses OpenAI's DALL-E API for generating logos and patterns.
- **Node.js and Express**: Lightweight and efficient server-side framework.

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before running the backend, ensure the following are installed on your system:

- **Node.js** (version 14 or higher)
- **npm** or **yarn**
